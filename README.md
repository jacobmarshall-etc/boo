## Boo

Boo is a dynamic version of the _very static_ [boo-photos](https://github.com/jacobmarshall/boo-photos) repository. Although not formally planned out, I do intend to add support for OAuth integration with Instagram in order to allow users to quickly, and easily, 'like' their favourites without having to head over to Instagram.
